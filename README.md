Got it! Here's a revised description that reflects having just the home and contact pages:

# Portfolio Website

Welcome to my portfolio website! This project is built using basic HTML and CSS, showcasing my skills and providing a way to contact me.

## Pages

- **Home Page**: An overview of my skills, experiences, and some highlights of my projects.
- **Contact Page**: A simple contact form to reach out to me.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For the structure and content of the website.
- **CSS**: For styling and layout.

## Getting Started

To view the website locally:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd your-repo-name
   ```
3. Open `index.html` in your web browser.


Replace `yourusername` and `your-repo-name` with your GitHub username and the repository name, and `your-email@example.com` with your email address.
